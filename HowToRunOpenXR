4.	Build Sample 
5.	For you to run openxr sample on ARGO you will need to include libopenxr_loader.so in your sample project 
6.	For simplicity I have pushed that file after installing the application
    adb push libopenxr_loader.so /data/app/~~60xpXw_kIbqUZWJz_IiGPg==/org.khronos.openxr.hello_xr.opengles-H_cLoU4J7AgHgShPefrGoQ==/lib/arm64/
